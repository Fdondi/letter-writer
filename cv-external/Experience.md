# Experience

## Hoshii

Location: Zürich  
Time: 2 months, April-May 2025

### Short version:

Delivered a React webshop, integrating with MongoDb and Go backend, expanding the API as needed. Improved the AI orchestration pipeline.

### Longer version:

I learnt to debug and develop the LangChain pipeline with LangSmith, gaining experience in how to decompose complex problems with highly variable results into ones that can be faced by current LLMs, and recomposed.

My main project was adding a basic webshop on top of the existing backend. This was developed in React, and it required expanding the Go backend and underlying MongoDB to support the additional functions. Communication happened through REST API / Gin.

### Why I’m no longer with them:

It's an early stage startup where I was the 4th developer, and by a margin the oldest. The CTO decided not to continue despite not only mastering their tech stack in 2 weeks, but delivering a nearly complete project in the following 2\. He stressed that in a normal company he would have kept me, but in such a critical moment where the company had to make it or break it, he felt I hadn't meshed with the team as well as he needed.

### Tools:

- LangChain/LangSmith  
- Python  
- Pydantic LLM API calls  
- React  
  - npm  
  - i18next  
- Golang  
- REST API / Gin  
- MongoDB  
- Cursor  
- Kubernetes  
- GitLab CI

## Giotto AI

Location: Remote (Zürich), week-long offsides in Lausanne and Milan.  
Time: 4 months, September 2024 \- January 2025 

### Short version:

Contributed to cutting-edge research tackling the ARC challenge. Especially focused on data augmentation. Extensively used BART for classification, and Pytorch/Lightning for efficient multi-GPU training. 

### Longer version:

First we focused on the ARC challenge. It’s a competition that focuses on creating models which are able to learn rules from as few examples as it would take a human.  
My role was initially to support the Python infrastructure for the PhDs to work their magic; but as time went on, I also took on more directly AI roles, especially generating synthetic data. We placed 11th worldwide in the ARC competition.

Following the competition, we turned to applying the learning to similar fields. My group settled on comparing CVs for hiring; a field in which, due to privacy reasons, it’s also common to have few examples to train on. In about a month, my team was able to fine-tune a BART model to mostly reproduce the dataset’s ranking of CVs for a job description. The model could be run on a RTX3090 GPU.  

### Why I’m no longer with them:

I was initially hired on a temporary contract, but the CEO in person was so happy to work with me he decided to make an exception to hire me permanently. Unfortunately, the main client pulled the contract, and they had to fire most of the company.

### Tools:

- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Fine tuning  
- LLM / BART

### Tools:

- Linux  
- Python  
- Docker  
- React

### Why I’m no longer with them:

No explanation given, but I suppose the project must have been shut down. It was a two-person project, and the previous developer had just left after teaching me essential information to keep it running, which they didn't ask me to pass on in any way.

Time: 1 year 3 months, June 2021 \- September 2022

### Short version:

Developed the SQL optimization engine and testing infrastructure.

*  Expanded supported SQL syntax and optimizations  
*  reworked the test framework to support new test suite  
* contributed to rewriting to higher standards the optimization engine

### Longer version:

(todo)

### Tools:

- C++  
- SQL

### Why I’m no longer with them:

The immediate cause was a rise in interest rates, but I should have used the time better to understand the business better, and become more necessary for it, instead of narrowly focusing on the task at hand. Lesson learned. 

### Reference letter

Francesco Dondi, born on 29 October 1990 in Italy, was employed by Firebolt
Analytics between 01 June 2021 and 08 September 2022. Francesco worked as a
Senior Software Engineer in the SQL planner team of Firebolt.
Firebolt’s planner team owns the SQL compilation pipeline for our cloud data
warehouse. The team is responsible for our customer-facing SQL dialect, as well
as the quality of our optimized query plans. In Firebolt’s planner team, Francesco
had a significant impact on improving the maturity of Firebolt’s product.
● Francesco helped drive a large infrastructure project completely rebuilding
Firebolt’s SQL compiler. He took initiative to enable our system to be more
compliant with the SQL language standards while paying close attention to
the experience of our customers by minimizing customer-facing breaking
changes.
● Francesco worked on developing new Firebolt features, as well as fixing
bugs in the existing codebase. A SQL compiler is a large, complicated code
base. Francesco did an exceptional job understanding the system and
contributing to it, over time becoming an expert on database internals.
● Francesco took ownership of porting a large open-source SQL test suite to
run on the Firebolt data warehouse. This entailed building tooling to
automatically rewrite millions of SQL queries between different dialects.
Francesco’s work here allowed us to better understand the limitations of our
system and improve our product maturity.
The quality of Francesco’s work was consistently high. He sought out challenging
engineering projects and helped drive them to success. In a fast-moving startup
environment like the one of Firebolt, large projects come with a lot of uncertainty
around requirements, timelines, and execution. Francesco learned how to operate
well in this environment, always helping junior engineers on the team.
Francesco was a pleasure to work with for his superiors and colleagues at
Firebolt. As an intelligent, friendly, and open colleague, he helped the team
operate well in a remote setting.
We thank Francesco for his work at Firebolt, his contributions to our SQL compiler
were significant. We wish him all the best, both personally and professionally in his
next endeavor.

# Ascent Software

Location: Luqa, Malta  
Time: 1 year 6 months, April 2016 \- October 2017

### Short version:

I helped maintain and develop a driver (C++) for automotive communications, running both on regular computers and embedded (QNX real-time OS) systems.

### Longer version:

It was a great experience to consolidate my C++ into a deep and dependable skill. I also was introduced to having to code for a non-standard platform with a quirky compiler (QNX), as well as having to test with physical devices. The job was creating drivers translating between our API and the various drivers coming with the devices; which was good training to thinking about the flow of data given arbitrary constraints at the endpoints. 

### Tools:

- C++  
- QNX  
- CAN/LIN/FlexRay protocols.  
- Physical devices

### Why I’m no longer with them:

I left for Google.

It was my first programming job. It was split between Rulex (a startup spinoff of the CNR) and the CNR itself. On the Rulex side, it allowed me to put into practice various algorithms for parallelism, as well as try out CUDA. On the CNR side, it was an introduction to Python and MATLAB, as well as pre-ML computer vision techniques.

### Tools:

- C  
- Nvidia CUDA  
- OpenMP  
- MATLAB  
- Python
