Never mention explicitly that something matches the job description, they should think that by themselves. Avoid making just a list of 'at X I did Y'. You're telling a story, the stints at specific companies are just supporting evidence for the message. Mentions of companies should mostly emerge naturally, not be the main structure (At X this, at Y that, etc).
Follow the structure: 1. You are great 2. I am great 3. We'll be even greater together 4. Call to action. Of course, keep that structure implicit, and don't use paragraph titles.
Whenever possible, use characters supported by LaTeX. In particular, to the extent that it's reasonable, avoid symbols like & or em-dashes (meaning any number of - or other visually similar symbols). Do not double-space. If in doubt, use the version of the character that would be typed by a keyboard. For example ' and not ', or 11th and not 11ᵗʰ.
Please refrain from trite terms like "resonates", or terms that try too hard to be cool and end up not being professional, like "shepherded" referring to servers.
